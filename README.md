# House-Price-Prediction-using-ML
Overview

This project focuses on predicting house prices using machine learning techniques in Google Colab. It explores various regression models to determine the best approach for accurate price predictions based on real estate features.

Dataset

The dataset used contains multiple features such as:

Location

Size (Square Feet)

Number of Bedrooms & Bathrooms

Age of Property

Nearby Amenities

Market Trends

Source

The dataset can be sourced from platforms like Kaggle, Zillow, or Government Housing Records.

Tools & Technologies Used

Python

Google Colab

Pandas, NumPy for data manipulation

Matplotlib, Seaborn for data visualization

Scikit-learn for machine learning models

XGBoost for advanced regression
Machine Learning Models Used

Linear Regression

Decision Tree Regressor

Random Forest Regressor

XGBoost Regressor

Workflow

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, outliers, and feature scaling.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding correlations and feature importance.

Model Selection & Training: Comparing multiple models.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizing the best model.

Evaluation: Using metrics like MAE, RMSE, and RÂ² score.

Results & Insights

The best-performing model was XGBoost, with the highest accuracy.

Feature importance analysis revealed that location and size had the greatest impact on house prices.

Future Improvements

Integrate deep learning models for better accuracy.

Add real-time web scraping for dynamic pricing data.

Deploy the model using Flask or FastAPI.
